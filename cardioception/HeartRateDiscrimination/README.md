# The Heart Rate Discrimination task

## Staircases

Two staircasing procedure are implemented and can be controlled through the `staircase` parameters in the logging screen:

* nUp/nDown
This procedure will vary the absolute intensity of the stimuli (alpha parameter), the beats frequency is then adapted by adding or substracting this value to the initial beats frequency depending on the condition ('More' or 'Less'). A correct answer is recorded when the participant can correctly guess the condition ('More' or 'Less'), and the intensity is then decreased.

* Psi
This procedure will vary the intensity of the beats frequency from -40.5 bpm to 40.5 bpm. A correct answer is recorded when the participant responds 'More', and an incorrect answer is recorded when the participant responds 'Less'. An ideal observer should therefore end with a threshold estimated at 0.
