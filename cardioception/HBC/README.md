The Heart Beat Counting task
==================================

**The instructions are the following:**

>Without manually checking can you silently count each heartbeat you feel in your body from the time you hear the first tone to when you hear the second tone.

**The accuracy score is calculated using the following equation:**

The interoceptive accuracy score is computed using the formula proposed by Hart et al.<sup>4</sup> as follow:

<div class="MathJax_Display" style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Score=1-\frac{\left | N_{real} - N_{reported} \right |}{\frac{N_{real} + N_{reported}}{2}}" align="center"/>
</div>

After each counting response, the participant is prompted to rate their subjective confidence (from 0 to 100), used to calculate "interoceptive awareness", i.e. the relationship of confidence and accuracy. Total task runtime using default settings is approximately **4 minutes**.
